This repository contains the Homework 1 of Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining (Sc.M. in Data Science) course.
I am still a prospective student, I am waiting for the result of the prerequisite-check in probability, carried out on Friday 1st October.
I will upload the scripts of the first problem and update the pdf with the screenshoots of the HackerRank submissions as soon as possible.
